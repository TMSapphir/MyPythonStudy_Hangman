\# MyPythonJourney: Hangman Game 🪝😨



Hello! I'm Tiziano! This is my second repository! I'm currently learning more about Python and now, for training, i've tried to make a small code to replicate the Hangman Game. I've used modules to separate task to train with this tool of python



\## 🛠️ Project: The Game



The Repository has 2 folder



\- \*\*Normal Game:\*\* in this folder, i've replicated a normal Handman game. The missing letters are indicated with `\_`.

\- \*\*Encrypted Game:\*\* in this folder i tried to implement my old XOR encrypter to indicate missing letters.



\### 🎉 Normal Game

\- In this folder there is the normal game with the `\_` indicators

\- when the game start, you can insert every character. the code work also with capital letters.

\- When you win there is the message: `HAI VINTO!!! LA PAROLA ERA \[THE CORRECT WORD]`

\- When you loose, you can see the Hangman with the message: `EMOTIONAL DAMAGE! YOU ARE FAILURE!`

\- I tried to implement a replay comand, but i've to work to implement it



\### 🔐 Encrypted Game



\- In this folder there is the version of the game where there isn't the normal `\_` indicator, but the letter is cripted with a bitwise manipulation with XOR operator. This is the code I used in my first repository and implemented in the game

\- For this version I stored the cryptation key in a separated file called `def\_keymaster.py`. This is a piece of high italian licterature of the last century.





\## 🗑️ Modular Structure



\- \*\*The Hangman:\*\* the hangman array is stored in `impiccato\_codice.py`.

\- \*\*The Correct Word:\*\* the correct words are stored in `codice\_parola.py` for the normal game and `codice\_gioco\_cifrato.py` for the encrypted one. The possibles words are stored in the `a` list and are estracted with a `rd.randint(0, len(word\_array)-1)` function that indicate the index of the chosen word. 

\- \*\*The Game:\*\* the game motor are stored in `codice\_gioco.py` for the normal game and `codice\_gioco\_cifrato.py` for the encrypted one. 

\- \*\*The Encryption Key:\*\* the poem that makes up the encryption key is stored in `def\_keymaster.py`
